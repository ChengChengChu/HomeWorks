## Round 1
ceaser decrypt
## Round 2 
rail fence decrypt
## Round 3 
We have plain1, cypher1, and cypher2. (denoted as p1, c1, c2)
So the way to get plain2 is p1 xor c1 xor x2. 
Note that we can decrypt the cypher text only if the length of c1 is larger than c2. 
## Round 4 
bacon cypher + rail fence.
